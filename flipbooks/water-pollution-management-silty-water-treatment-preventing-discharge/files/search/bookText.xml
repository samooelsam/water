         •    In steep channels where storm water velocities exceed 1.5 m/s.

         •    During the establishment of grass linings in drainage ditches or
              channels

         •    In temporary ditches where the short length of service does not
              warrant establishment of erosion-resistant linings

          The size of the infiltration area required is a function of:

          •      The volume of water needing treatment
          •      The permeability of the ground


          The infiltration area needs to be covered in vegetation.


          Excessive amounts of sediment in the water being treated may
          cause the soil to become blocked, reducing the rate at which
          water will soak into the ground
