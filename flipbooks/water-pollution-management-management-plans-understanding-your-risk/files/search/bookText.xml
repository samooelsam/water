                                      The CIRIA Method does not take the slope of the site into account.  For steep sites use the
                                      MAFF Method.


                                      The CIRIA method has a number of conservative assumptions built into it, has a tendency
                                      to overestimate the peak flow.

                is purchased


         •      To identify sites where additional technical support of the project team is required

         •      To provide consistency in approach from one project to another


         •      To develop routine monitoring programs to include the consideration of the water environment


         •      To encourage a proactive approach to the management of project risks

         Purpose



         To reduce the risk of contamination of controlled waters caused by our work activities. Specifically, this involves:


         •   Identifying sources of potential contamination (surface and silt water run-off, fuel and chemical storage,

             excavation pumping operations etc.)


         •   Determining the receptors (water courses, ground water and foul drains) for any potential discharge and
             identifying whether this site is a ‘High’ risk development


         •   Developing and implementing controls for minimising risk, through control and treatment


         •   Utilising appointed technical consultants to assist in developing appropriate and effective methods of control


         •   Ensuring effective Monitoring and Maintenance of pollution prevention measures


         •   Developing a specific and effective Surface Water Management Plan, using this template


         •   Preparation of an associated Pollution Incident Response Plan for emergency situations (HSS-FO-001-Spill)

         •   Assurance of effectiveness through the implementation of inspection, monitoring and sampling measures, using

             the associated HSS-FO-001 Water Management & Pollution Prevention Inspection Checklists found on Airsweb.
