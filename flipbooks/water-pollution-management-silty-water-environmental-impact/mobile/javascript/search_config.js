Fine grained          soils (fine silts and clays) have poor settling characteristics, making them          more difficult to recover.            Vegetation          Helps slow water velocities, encouraging it to soak into the ground and           bind the soil together. Erosion rates are greater on exposed (bare soil)                                   Erosion = exposed soil X overland flow of water           Annual rainfall           The greater the rainfall the greater the amount of run-off which will be          generated            Drainage Area           The greater the area drained, the larger the volume of water which will          be generated.                       johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk","How silty water affects a water course                                                                                             •   A 5 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) increase in turbidity in a clear water                                                                                    lake may reduce the productive volume of that lake by about 80%                                                                                 •   A 25 NTU increase in a clear water stream 0.5 m deep may reduce plant                                                                                    production by approximately 50% (Lloyd et al. 1987)                                                                                  •   A 5 NTU increase in turbidity in a clear stream 0.5 m deep may reduce                                                                                    primary production by 13% or more, depending on stream depth                                                                                                                               Environmental Harm                                                                                                                               •      Can suffocate fish by blocking gills                                                                                                                             •      Can strip out dissolved oxygen                                                                                                                              •      Prevent sunlight penetrating the water                                                                                                                              •      Settle out on the bed of the river                                                                                                                             •      Blind off of gravel beds                                                                                                                              •      Combine with other contaminants                   johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk","Man made vs natural (1)                                                                           johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk","Man made vs natural (2)                                                                           johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk","Summary                 •      Silt pollution is a common pollutant that is often overlooked            •      The release of even small quantities of sediment into a                 waterway can have dire consequences for the health                  (biodiversity) of the water body           •      Large extents of our inland waterways are being adversely                 affected by sediment            •      Human activities are the main cause            •      Construction sites can be a major source of silt pollution                                               Prevent silt pollution…                                protect the environment                          johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk","Contact details                     Simon Skentelbery           General Manager               John F Hunt           Regeneration Ltd                London Road             Grays             Essex             RM20 4DB               M: 07967 306 517               E:   simon.skentelbery@johnfhunt.co.uk             W: johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                              johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk                                            +44(0)1375 366 700                                       info@johnfhuntregeneration.co.uk"];
